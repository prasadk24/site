                <br>
                <p>At ACCESS, we don’t just place teachers or deliver programs—we follow a structured, long-term
                    approach:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Build:</strong> Identify potential educators and train them rigorously through our
                        Teacher
                        Readiness Program (TRP).</li>
                    <li><strong>Deploy:</strong> Place trained, classroom-ready teachers and trainers where schools need
                        them most.</li>
                    <li><strong>Support:</strong> Provide continuous mentoring, performance monitoring, and on-ground
                        support.</li>
                    <li><strong>Improve:</strong> Use feedback, observation, and data to continuously enhance teacher
                        performance and student outcomes.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This approach ensures consistency, sustainability, and measurable impact across classrooms.</p>
